## Instructions
I'm running the entire application on VScode. I've installed the Python extension and was able to get the Flask application started by entering the following lines of code into my vscode terminal: 

### Dependencies: 

Pip installation

```
/usr/local/bin/python3.11 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
Flask installation
```
/usr/local/bin/python3.11 -m pip install flask
```
Flask-CORS installation
```
/usr/local/bin/python3.11 -m pip install Flask-CORS
```

After this you can install and run the react front end to view and test the application. 
```
npm install
```
```
npm run start
```
